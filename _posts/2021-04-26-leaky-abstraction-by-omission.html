		Consider the following interface definition. What's wrong with it?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepository</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;Reservation?&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservation</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Update</span>(Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps you think that the name is incorrect; that this really isn't an example of the Repository design pattern, as it's described in <a href="/ref/peaa">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>. Ironically, of all patterns, it may be the one most affected by <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html">semantic diffusion</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's not what I have in mind, though. There's something else with that interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's not its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> design, either. You could consider that a leaky abstraction, since it strongly implies a sort of persistent data store. That's a worthwhile discussion, but not what I have in mind today. There's something else wrong with the interface.
	</p>
	<h3 id="998668fec2d9488db5a31a99c0c81774">
		Consistency <a href="#998668fec2d9488db5a31a99c0c81774" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Look closer at the parameters for the various methods. The <code>Create</code> and <code>ReadReservations</code> methods take a <code>restaurantId</code> parameter, but the other three don't.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why does the <code>ReadReservations</code> method take a <code>restaurantId</code> while <code>ReadReservation</code> doesn't? Why is that parameter required for <code>Create</code>, but not for <code>Update</code>? That doesn't seem consistent.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reason is that each reservation has an ID (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">GUID</a>). Once the reservation exists, you can uniquely identify it to read, update, or delete it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter suggests, however, this interface is part of a multi-tenant code base. This code base implements an online restaurant reservation system as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> API. It's an online service where each restaurant is a separate tenant.
	</p>
	<p>
		While each reservation has a unique ID, the system still needs to associate it with a restaurant. Thus, the <code>Create</code> method must take a <code>restaurantId</code> parameter in order to associate the reservation with a restaurant.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the reservation is stored, however, it's possible to uniquely identify it with the ID. The <code>ReadReservation</code>, <code>Update</code>, and <code>Delete</code> methods need only the <code>id</code> to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, when you're <em>not</em> querying on reservation ID, you'll need to identify the restaurant, as with the <code>ReadReservations</code> methods. If you didn't identify the restaurant in that method, you'd get all reservations in the requested range, from all tenants. That's not what you want. Therefore, you must supply the <code>restaurantId</code> to limit the query.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interface is inconsistent, but also allows the underlying implementation to leak through.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		If I told you that the implementation of <code>IReservationsRepository</code> is based on a relational database, can you imagine the design? You may want to stop reading and see if you can predict what the database looks like.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interface strongly implies a design like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">CREATE</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">TABLE</span>&nbsp;[dbo]<span style="color:gray;">.</span>[Reservations]<span style="color:blue;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Name]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">NVARCHAR&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>50<span style="color:gray;">)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Email]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">NVARCHAR&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>50<span style="color:gray;">)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Quantity]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">INT</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PublicId]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">UNIQUEIDENTIFIER</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RestaurantId]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">INT</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">PRIMARY</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">KEY</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">CLUSTERED&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>[Id]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">ASC</span><span style="color:gray;">),</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">CONSTRAINT</span>&nbsp;[AK_PublicId]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">UNIQUE</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">NONCLUSTERED&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>[PublicId]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">ASC</span><span style="color:gray;">)</span>
<span style="color:gray;">);</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		What I wrote above is even clearer now. You can't create a row in that table without supplying a <code>RestaurantId</code>, since that column has a <code>NOT NULL</code> constraint.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>PublicId</code> column has a <code>UNIQUE</code> constraint, which means that you can uniquely read and manipulate a single row when you have an ID.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since all reservations are in a single table, any query <em>not</em> based on <code>PublicId</code> should also filter on <code>RestaurantId</code>. If it doesn't, the result set could include reservations from all restaurants.
	</p>
	<h3 id="646f0fb2adf147c6bca42d9aada6cf43">
		Other interpretations <a href="#646f0fb2adf147c6bca42d9aada6cf43" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Is the above relational database design the only possible implementation? Perhaps not. You could implement the interface based on a document database as well. It'd be natural to store each reservation as a separate document with a unique ID. Again, once you have the ID, you can directly retrieve and manipulate the document.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other implementations become harder, though. Imagine, for example, that you want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)">shard</a> the database design: Each restaurant gets a separate database. Or perhaps, more realistically, you distribute tenants over a handful of databases, perhaps partitioned on physical location, or some other criterion.
	</p>
	<p>
		With such a design, the <code>ReadReservation</code>, <code>Update</code>, and <code>Delete</code> methods become more inefficient. While you should be able to identify the correct shard if you have a restaurant ID, <em>you don't have that information.</em> Instead, you'll have to attempt the operation on all databases, thereby eliminating most  sharding benefits.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other words, the <em>absence</em> of the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter from some of the methods suggests certain implementation details.
	</p>
	<h3 id="5edc25ddf2c8439096577e8eaf45806c">
		Leak by omission <a href="#5edc25ddf2c8439096577e8eaf45806c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I admit that I rarely run into this sort of problem. Usually, a leaky abstraction manifests by a language construct that contains <em>too much</em> information. This is typically an interface or base class that exposes implementation details by either requiring too specific inputs, or by returning data that reveals implementation details.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a data access abstraction like the above 'repository', this most frequently happens when people design such an interface around an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">object-relational mapper</a> (ORM). A class like <code>Reservation</code> would then typically carry ORM details around. Perhaps it inherits from an ORM base class, or perhaps (this is very common) it has a parameterless constructor or getters and setters that model the relationships of the database (these are often called <em>navigation properties</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Another common examples of a leaky abstraction might be the presence of <code>Connect</code> and <code>Disconnect</code> methods. The <code>Connect</code> method may even take a <code>connectionString</code> parameter, clearly leaking that some sort of database is involved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet another example is <a href="/2014/08/11/cqs-versus-server-generated-ids">CQS-violating designs where a <code>Create</code> method returns a database ID</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		All such leaky abstractions are leaky because they expose or require too much information.
	</p>
	<p>
		The example in this article, on the contrary, is leaky because of a lack of detail.

		Dependency Inversion Principle <a href="#d6391eb7487d4b3ca38e4e5b1e868bd5" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Ironically, I originally arrived at the above design because I followed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</a> (DIP). The clients of <code>IReservationsRepository</code> are ASP.NET Controller actions, like this <code>Delete</code> method:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[HttpDelete(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;restaurants/{restaurantId}/reservations/{id}&quot;</span>)]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">async</span>&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(Guid.TryParse(id,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">out</span>&nbsp;var&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">rid</span>))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">r</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.ReadReservation(rid)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.Delete(rid).ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(r&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;PostOffice.EmailReservationDeleted(restaurantId,&nbsp;r)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As Robert C. Martin explains about the Dependency Inversion Principle:
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				"clients [...] own the abstract interfaces"
			</p>
			<footer><cite>Robert C. Martin, <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">APPP</a>, chapter 11</cite></footer>
		</blockquote>
		From that principle, it follows that the <code>Delete</code> method decides what <code>IReservationsRepository.Delete</code> looks like. It seems that the Controller action doesn't <em>need</em> to tell the <code>Repository</code> about the <code>restaurantId</code> when calling its <code>Delete</code> method. Supplying the reservation ID (<code>rid</code>) is enough.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are, however, various problems with the above code. If the DIP suggests that the <code>restaurantId</code> is redundant when calling <code>Repository.Delete</code>, then why is it required when calling <code>PostOffice.EmailReservationDeleted</code>? This seems inconsistent.
	</p>
	<p>
		Indeed it is.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I often do, I arrived at the above <code>Delete</code> method via <a href="/outside-in-tdd">outside-in TDD</a>, but as I observed a decade ago, <a href="/2010/12/22/TheTDDApostate">TDD alone doesn't guarantee good design</a>. Even when following the <a href="/2019/10/21/a-red-green-refactor-checklist">red-green-refactor checklist</a>, I often fail to spot problems right away.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's okay. TDD doesn't guarantee perfection, but done well it should set you up so that you can easily make changes.
	</p>

		Possible remedies <a href="#b19d4f16b2ee48759c0e4d698a83cfdc" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I can think of two ways to address the problem. The simplest solution is to make the interface consistent by adding a <code>restaurantId</code> parameter to all methods:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepository</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;Reservation?&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservation</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Update</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the simplest solution, and the one that I prefer. In a future article, I'll show how it enabled me to significantly simplify the code base.
	</p>
	<p>
		For good measure, though, I should also mention the opposite solution. Completely drain the interface of <code>restaurantId</code> parameters:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepository</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;Reservation?&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservation</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Update</span>(Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		How can that work in practice? After all, an implementation <em>must</em> have a restaurant ID in order to create a new row in the database.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's possible to solve that problem by making the <code>restaurantId</code> an implementation detail. You could make it a constructor parameter for the concrete class, but this gives you another problem. Your <a href="/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot">Composition Root</a> doesn't know the restaurant ID - after all, it's a run-time argument.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a method like the above <code>Delete</code> Controller action, you'd have to translate the <code>restaurantId</code> run-time argument to an <code>IReservationsRepository</code> instance. There are various ways around that kind of problem, but they typically involve some kind of <em>factory</em>. That'd be yet another interface:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepositoryFactory</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IReservationsRepository&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That just makes the API more complicated. Factories give <a href="/dippp">Dependency Injection</a> a bad reputation. For that reason, I don't like this second alternative.
	</p>
	<h3 id="ae975d7eff014d31b26ec78fa055f343">
		Conclusion <a href="#ae975d7eff014d31b26ec78fa055f343" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Leaky abstractions usually express themselves as APIs that expose too many details; the implementation details leak through.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example, however, a leaky abstraction manifested as a lack of consistency. Some methods require a <code>restaurantId</code> argument, while others don't - because one particular implementation doesn't need that information.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turned out, though, that when I was trying to simplify the overall code, this API design held me back. Consistently adding <code>restaurantId</code> parameters to all repository methods solved the problem. <a href="/2021/05/10/simplifying-code-with-decorated-commands">A future article tells that tale</a>.

            <p>Thank you for the article Mark.</p>

            <p>I was wondering whether another solution would be including restaurantId as a member of Reservation? That
                way it’s not needed by the Create method. </p>

            <p>That just leaves ReadReservations as the last method that requires a restaurant ID, but one could argue a
                specialized read method such as this one doesn’t belong on a repository anyway. I personally tend to
                interpret these kinds of methods on a repository as a code smell on projects of a certain size. </p>

				Tobias, thank you for writing. You raise a good point, and it might be an appropriate way to model the problem. While the thought had already crossed my mind, I must admit that I hadn't given it much thought.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the individual CRUD operations, I admit that it might be an appropriate design option. You do, however, also point to the <code>ReadReservations</code> method as the odd man out. I applaud the intellectual honesty you exhibit by bring this up yourself, and I don't intend to misuse it by shooting down your idea. The fact that this method is somehow different might be an indication that it doesn't belong as a member of the same interface as the other four methods.
			</p>
			<p>
				If that's the case, though, then where does it belong? One option would be to <a href="/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional">define all interfaces with only a single method</a>:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsDateRangeQuery</span>
{ 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				How should we deal with the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter in such an interface? Should it be included, as is the case here, or should we exclude it from the interface definition, like the following?
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>
Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);</pre>

				If we choose to exclude the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter from the interface, it'd be consistent with the CRUD interface that you imply. On the other hand, wouldn't it require some sort of factory, as <a href="#b19d4f16b2ee48759c0e4d698a83cfdc">I outlined above</a>?
			</p>
			<p>
				Conversely, if we decide to keep the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter as part of the interface definition, it seems inconsistent with the design your suggestion implies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm not writing this to shoot down your suggestion. I find it a real conundrum.
			</p>
			<p>
				I do think, though, that this might be an indication that there's some kind of abstraction that I've failed to make explicit. Some kind of <em>Restaurant</em> or <em>Tenant</em> type seems most likely.
			</p>
			<p>
				My problem is that <a href="/2020/10/19/monomorphic-functors">I actually do have a <code>Restaurant</code> class</a> in my code base. That one, however, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object">Value Object</a>, so I'm loath to add impure methods to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				For what it's worth, it's deliberation like this that makes software design interesting. You need to balance opposing forces. A good design is one that does so in a stable way. I'm not claiming that the code shown here does that. You've clearly put your finger on a sore spot, which suggests to me that there's more work to be done. Thank you for the inspiring input!

				Hi Mark, thank you for another great article!
		   	</p>
			<p>
				I have worked on several small multi-tenant systems and I faced the same problem as you with the repository interface methods and the "tenant id" being mixed.
			</p>
			<p>
				After several attempts and API iteration, my final design was to use what <em>Steven van Deursen</em> calls <a href="https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/posts/2019/ambient-composition-model/">The Ambient Composition Model</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea is to inject an <code>ITenantContext</code> in the <code>IReservationsRepository</code> implementation and to use it as needed :
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>
					public class ReservationsRepository : IReservationsRepository {
						private readonly ITenantContext _tenantContext;
						
						public ReservationRepository(ITenantContext tenantContext) {
							_tenantContext = tenantContex;
						}
						
						public Task Create(Reservation reservation) {
							var restaurantId = _tenantContext.RestaurantId;
							// ...
						}
					}
				</pre>
				
			</p>

			<p>
				In my case the implementation of the <code>ITenantContext</code> was retrieving the tenant from the route of the method. I think it could be the same for resolving the <code>restaurantId</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				This solution seems similar to your Factory solution but I'm not totally sure. In any case, like the Factory solution, this solution is heavier that the first you proposed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nonetheless I find some elegance in this solution with the tenant being injected by request in the implementation. What do you think? Did you have the same idea with the Factory solution?
			</p>

				Thibaut, thank you for writing. Yes, that's another option. I've done something similar to that in the past.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a sense, the concept of a <em>tenant</em> seems almost like a cross-cutting concern, so it makes sense to let it fade into the background, so to speak.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason I'm not too keen on that any longer is that it seems a bit too 'clever' in most settings. Consider the <code>Delete</code> Controller action <a href="#d6391eb7487d4b3ca38e4e5b1e868bd5">shown above</a>. Imagine that we inject <code>restaurantId</code> into all services - not only <code>IReservationsRepository </code>, but also into <code>IPostOffice</code>. The <code>Delete</code> method might look like this, then:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>[HttpDelete(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;restaurants/{restaurantId}/reservations/{id}&quot;</span>)]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">async</span>&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(Guid.TryParse(id,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">out</span>&nbsp;var&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">rid</span>))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">r</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.ReadReservation(rid)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.Delete(rid).ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(r&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;PostOffice.EmailReservationDeleted(r)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>restaurantId</code> parameter still has to be present, even though it's unused. This is likely to be puzzling to any developer not intimately familiar with the code base.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's possible that you can pull some trick with the ASP.NET framework so that the parameter doesn't have to be there, but it'll still be present in the URL, and again, I'm concerned that most developers would be confused about this.
			</p>
			<p>
				There's also another thing that bothers me about design like this: You can pull the restaurant ID out of the method's routing data, but this implies that you can do the same with the reservation ID. What makes the restaurant ID special, that it ought to be an injected dependency, while the reservation ID isn't?
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm concerned that the answer to that question might be 'hand-wavy'. And if we can't defend making one ID a dependency and the other not, then we might take this to the logical conclusion and inject all routing values into services. If we do that, the <code>Delete</code> method might now look like this:
			</p>
			<pre>[HttpDelete(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;restaurants/{restaurantId}/reservations/{id}&quot;</span>)]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">async</span>&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(Repository.IsIdValid)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">r</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.ReadReservation()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.Delete().ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(r&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;PostOffice.EmailReservationDeleted(r)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
			<p>
				(I haven't tried to compile this, so there may be syntax errors.)
			</p>
			<p>
				This seems really odd, although it's possible that we can salvage it by calling the dependency something else than <code>Repository</code>. It's not really a Unit of Work, but seems closer to that sort of design.
			</p>
			<p>
				I agree that a tenant feels like something that ought to be 'automatically handled', but I wonder whether it's possible to do that without making the code 'too clever'.

				How would YAGNI come into play here? For instance, imagine your "client" code wasn't the Delete endpoint, but it was another app or endpoint that only had a "Guid reservationId", but <i>not</i> an "int restaurantId".
				In such case, wouldn't you be forced to add the restaurantId to the client code? What if this client code doesn't have an easy way to obtain such restaurantId? The reservation id is a global identifier, thus it makes sense that some application (be it a service, console, etc) would just get hold of the guid and nothing else, it's universally identifiable after all, it <i>should</i> be able to identify the reservation uniquely. 
				This may require more roundtrips to the database, or forcing another client one-level above to provide the restaurantId (and this may even require politics and management to get in).
			</p>
			<p>
				Wouldn't YAGNI say that you shouldn't add the restaurantId to the API, since you ain't gonna need it? I.e, you likely won't change your data access implementation or shard the database in a way that would require that additional restaurantId, and even if you did, perhaps the development effort to add the restaurantId would be the same in that future timeline as it would be right now, so it would be the same to make this change now or afterwards (and in such case, wouldn't it make much sense to make the change afterwards, when you actually need it?).

				Gonzalo, thank you for writing. The short answer is that I only 'discovered' the leaky abstraction because I did, in fact, need the restaurant ID. As part of creating, modifying, or deleting reservations, I <a href="/2021/05/10/simplifying-code-with-decorated-commands">also wanted to send email updates</a>. For example, when updating a reservation, the system should send an email with a subject line like "Your reservation for Nono changed."
			</p>
			<p>
				This meant that I had to figure out which name to put in the subject line. Given the restaurant ID, this is trivial, but without it, the system would first have to make a 'reverse lookup' to find the restaurant associated with the reservation ID. While it's technically possible, it seems overly complicated given that the <code>restaurantId</code> was already available at the entry point.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's true that since the reservation ID is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">GUID</a>, it's globally unique. This, however, is an implementation detail. The system <a href="/2020/10/26/fit-urls">doesn't allow external client to refer to a reservation exclusively by a GUID</a>. Rather, from the perspective of an external client, the ID of a reservation looks like <code>https://api.example.com/restaurants/90125/reservations/667fd3ca5d6943b993860809adc99ad5?sig=aqwnNXj28J547upBELNf5I6yPIrQ%2BG9DG2QIAlOpgOE%3D</code>. While both restaurant and reservation IDs are <em>visible</em> within that string, a client can't use those IDs. The external reservation ID is the full (conceptually opaque) string.
			</p>
			<p>
				I agree, though, that YAGNI is relevant in this context, too. If it's any consolation, I didn't change the code 'just in case' - I did, in fact, change it because I realised that I needed the modified design. But I admit that I didn't explicitly state that in this article.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may also find the <a href="#3104d83e33524adc9f4d349fa4df20ed">above discussion</a> relevant.
