    Most programmers I meet know about <em>encapsulation</em> and <em>Object-Oriented Design</em> (OOD) - at least, until I start drilling them on specifics. Apparently, the way most people have been taught OOD is at odds with my view on the subject. For a long time, I've wanted to teach OOD the way I think it should be taught. My perspective is chiefly based on Bertrand Meyer's <a href="http://amzn.to/1claOin">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a> and Robert C. Martin's SOLID principles (presented, among other sources, in <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a>). My focus is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation</a>, protection of invariants, and favouring Composition over Inheritance.

    In <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/encapsulation-and-solid">my new Pluralsight course</a>, I'm happy to be able to teach OOD the way I think it should be taught. The course is aimed at professional developers with a couple of years of experience, but it's based on decades of experience (mine and others'), so I hope that even seasoned programmers can learn a thing or two from watching it.

    What you will learn <a href="#bfb677910e6842528247f1ad001063d2" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    How do you make your code easily usable for other people? By following the actionable, measurable rules laid forth by Command/Query Separation as well as Postelâ€™s law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learn how to write maintainable software that can easily respond to changing requirements, using object-oriented design principles. First, you'll learn about the fundamental object-oriented design principle of Encapsulation, and then you'll learn about the five SOLID principles - also known as <em>the principles of object-oriented design</em>. There are plenty of code examples along the way; they are in C#, but written in such a way that they should be easily understandable to readers of Java, or other curly-brace-based languages.

    Is OOD still relevant? <a href="#f52deb62d40c42f794dff91fa1a7640b" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular, and regular readers of this blog will have noticed that I, myself, write <a href="/tags.html#F#-ref">a fair amount of F# code</a>. In light of this, is OOD still relevant?
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a lot of Object-Oriented code out there, or at least, code written in a nominally Object-Oriented language, and it's not going to go away any time soon. Getting better at maintaining and evolving Object-Oriented code is, in my opinion, still important.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the principles I cover in this course are also relevant in Functional Programming.

    <div class="comment-content">I'm really enjoying your presentation! It is easy to follow and understand your explanations. I have a bit of a tangent question about your TryRead method in the Encapsulation module. You mention that your final implementation has a race condition in it. Can you explain the race condition?</div>

        Dan, thank you for writing. You are talking about this implementation, I assume:
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;TryRead(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;id,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">out</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;message)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;path&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.GetFileName(id);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">if</span>&nbsp;(!<span style="color:#2b91af;">File</span>.Exists(path))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">false</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">File</span>.ReadAllText(path);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">true</span>;
}</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        This implementation isn't thread-safe, because File.Exists(path) may return true, and then, <em>before</em> File.ReadAllText(path) is invoked, another thread or process could delete the file, causing an exception to be thrown when File.ReadAllText(path) is invoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's possible to <em>make</em> the TryRead method thread-safe (I know of at least two alternatives), but I usually leave that as an exercise for the reader :)
      </p>

      The only <em>safe</em> implementation that I am aware of would be something along the lines of:
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;TryRead(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;id,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">out</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;message)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;path&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.GetFileName(id);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">try</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">File</span>.ReadAllText(path);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">true</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">catch</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">false</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>

      Am I missing something?

        Bart, no, you aren't missing anything; that looks about right :) The other alternative is just a variation on your solution.
