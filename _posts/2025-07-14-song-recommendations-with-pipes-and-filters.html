        This article is part of a larger series that outlines various <a href="/2025/04/07/alternative-ways-to-design-with-functional-programming">alternative ways to design with functional programming</a>. That (first) article contains a table of contents, as well as outlines the overall programme and the running example. In short, the example is a song recommendation engine that works on large data sets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previous articles in this series have explored <a href="/2025/04/28/song-recommendations-as-an-impureim-sandwich">refactoring to a pure function</a> and <a href="/2025/06/09/song-recommendations-from-combinators">composing impure actions with combinators</a>. In the next few articles, we'll look at how to use message-based architectures to decouple the algorithm into smaller <a href="/2025/01/13/recawr-sandwich">Recawr Sandwiches</a>. As an overall concept, we may term such an architecture <em>pipes and filters</em>. The book <a href="/ref/eip">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a> is a great resource for this kind of (de)composition. Don't be mislead by the title: In essence, it's neither about enterprise programming nor integration.

    <p>
        As speculated in <a href="/2025/04/28/song-recommendations-as-an-impureim-sandwich">Song recommendations as an Impureim Sandwich</a>, the data sets involved when finding song recommendations for a user may be so large that an <a href="/2020/03/02/impureim-sandwich">Impureim Sandwich</a> is impractical.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, a message-based system essentially consists of many small message handlers that each may be implemented as Impureim Sandwiches. I've already briefly discussed this kind of decomposition in <a href="/2017/07/10/pure-interactions">Pure interactions</a>, where each message handler or 'actor' is a small process equivalent to a web request handler (Controller) or similar.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to the song recommendation problem, we may consider a small pipes-and-filters architecture that uses small 'filters' to start even more work, handled by other filters, and so on.

        Depending on the exact implementation details, you may call this <em>pipes and filters</em>, <em>reactive functional programming</em>, the <em>actor model</em>, <em>map/reduce</em>, or something else. What I consider crucial in this context is that each 'filter' is a small Recawr Sandwich. It queries the out-of-process music data service, applies a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a> to that data, and finally sends more messages over some impure channel. In the following articles, you'll see code examples.

        <li>Song recommendations with F# agents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As I'm writing this, I don't plan to supply a <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> example. The main reason is that I've no experience with writing asynchronous message-based systems with Haskell, and while a quick web search indicates that there are plenty of libraries for <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_Reactive_Programming">reactive functional programming</a>, on the other hand, I can't find much when it comes to message-bus-based asynchronous messaging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps it'd be more idiomatic to supply an <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> example, but it's been too many years since I tried teaching myself Erlang, and I never became proficient with it.

        It turns out that when you decompose the song recommendation problem into smaller 'filters', each of which is a Recawr Sandwich, you arrive at a decomposition that looks suspiciously close to what we saw in <a href="/2025/06/09/song-recommendations-from-combinators">Song recommendations from combinators</a>. And as <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/blog/pure-impure-segregation-principle">Oleksii Holub wrote</a>,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "However, instead of having one cohesive element to reason about, we ended up with multiple fragments, each having no meaning or value of their own. While unit testing of individual parts may have become easier, the benefit is very questionable, as it provides no confidence in the correctness of the algorithm as a whole."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This remains true here. Why even bother, then?
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this article series is to present alternatives, just like <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/">Scott Wlaschin</a>'s excellent article <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/13-ways-of-looking-at-a-turtle/">Thirteen ways of looking at a turtle</a>. It may be that a given design alternative isn't the absolute best fit for the song recommendation problem, but it may, on the other hand, be a good fit for some other problem that you run into. If so, you should be able to extrapolate from the articles in this series.

        Conclusion <a href="#577f32d80d674ac48c254e231f647d26">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Given that <a href="https://x.com/Tyrrrz/status/1493369905869213700">we know that the real code that the song recommendation example is based off runs for about ten minutes</a>, some kind of asynchronous process that may support progress indication or cancellation may be worth considering. This easily leads us in the direction of some kind of pipes-and-filters architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can implement such an architecture with in-memory message streams, as the next article does, or you can go with a full-fledged messaging system based on persistent message buses and distributed, restartable message handlers. The details vary, but it's essentially the same kind of architecture.
