    <p>
        If you're past <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">the novice stage</a> of learning programming, you will have noticed that there's usually more than one way to solve a particular problem. Sometimes one way is better than alternatives, but often, there's no single clearly superior option.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a cliche that you should use the right tool for the job. For programmers, our most important tools are the techniques, patterns, algorithms, and data structures we know, rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDEs</a> we use. You can only choose the right tool for a job if you have more than one to choose from. Again, for programmers this implies knowing of more than one way to solve a problem. This is the reason I find <a href="/2020/01/13/on-doing-katas">doing katas</a> so valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of a kata, in the series that this article commences I'll take a look at an example problem and in turn propose multiple alternative solutions. The problem I'll tackle is bigger than a typical kata, but you can think of this article series as a spirit companion to <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/13-ways-of-looking-at-a-turtle/">Thirteen ways of looking at a turtle</a> by <a href="https://scottwlaschin.com/">Scott Wlaschin</a>.

    </h3>
    <p>
        The problem I'll tackle was described by <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/">Oleksii Holub</a> in 2020, and I've been considering how to engage with it ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oleksii Holub presents it as <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/blog/pure-impure-segregation-principle#interleaved-impurities">the second of two examples</a> in an article named <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/blog/pure-impure-segregation-principle">Pure-Impure Segregation Principle</a>. In a nutshell, the problem is to identify song recommendations for a user, sourced from a vast repository of scrobbles.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first code example in the article is fine as well, but it's not as rich a source of problems, so I don't plan to talk about it in this context.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oleksii Holub's article does mention my article <a href="/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection">Dependency rejection</a> as well as the <a href="/2020/03/02/impureim-sandwich">Impureim Sandwich</a> pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's my experience that the Impureim Sandwich is surprisingly often applicable, despite its seemingly obvious limitations. More than once, people have responded that it doesn't work in general.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've never claimed that the Impureim Sandwich is a general-purpose solution to everything, only that it surprisingly often fits, once you massage the problem a bit:

        <li>Song recommendations as a Haskell Impureim Sandwich</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I have, however, <a href="/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection#36c724b49f614104842c47909cd9c916">solicited examples that challenge the pattern</a>, and occasionally readers supply examples, for which I'm thankful. I'm trying to get a sense for just how widely applicable the Impureim Sandwich pattern is, and finding its limitations is an important part of that work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The song recommendations problem is the most elusive one I've seen so far, so I'm grateful to Oleksii Holub for the example.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the articles in this series, I'll present various alternative solutions to that problem. To make things as clear as I can, I don't do this because I think that the code shown in the <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/blog/pure-impure-segregation-principle#interleaved-impurities">original article</a> is bad. Quite the contrary, I'd probably write it like that myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        I offer the alternatives to teach. Only by knowing of more than one way of solving the problem can you pick the right tool for the job. It may turn out that the right design is the one already suggested by Oleksii Holub, but if you change circumstances, perhaps another design is better. Ultimately, I hope that the reader can extrapolate from this problem to other problems that he or she may encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way much online discourse is conducted today, I wish that I didn't have to emphasise the following: Someone may choose to read Oleksii Holub's article as a rebuttal of my ideas about <a href="/2018/11/19/functional-architecture-a-definition">functional architecture</a> and the Impureim Sandwich. I don't read it that way, but rather as honest pursuit of intellectual inquiry. I engage with it in the same spirit, grateful for the rich example that it offers.

        I'll show code in the languages with which I'm most comfortable: C#, <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>, and <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. I'll attempt to write the C# code in such a way that programmers of Java, TypeScript, or similar languages can also read along. On the other hand, I'm not going to explain F# or Haskell, but I'll write the articles so that you can skip the F# or Haskell articles and still learn from the C# articles.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I don't expect the majority of my readers to know Haskell, I find it an indispensable tool when evaluating <a href="/2018/11/19/functional-architecture-a-definition">whether or not a design is functional</a>. F# is a good didactic bridge between C# and Haskell.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code is available upon request against a small <a href="/support">support donation</a> of 10 USD (or more). If you're one of my regular supporters, you have my gratitude and can get the code without further donation. Also, on his blog, <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/ukraine">Oleksii Holub asks you to support Ukraine against the aggressor</a>. If you can document that you've donated at least 10 USD to one of the charities listed there, on or after the publication of this article, I'll be happy to send you the code as well. In both cases, please <a href="/about#contact">write to me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've used Git branches for the various alternatives. In each article, I'll do my best to remember to write which branch corresponds to the article.

    <p>
        This article series will present multiple alternatives in more than one programming language. I find it most natural to group the articles according to design first, and language second.

        While you can view this list as a catalogue of functional programming designs, I'm under no illusion that it's complete.

        Some of the design alternatives will require detours to other interesting topics. While I'll do my best to write to enable you to skip the F# and Haskell content, few articles on this blog are self-contained. I do expect the reader to follow links when necessary, but if I've failed to explain anything to your satisfaction, please <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/ploeh.github.com#comments">leave a comment</a>.

    <p>
        This article series examines multiple alternative designs to the song recommendations example presented by Oleksii Holub. The original example has <em>interleaved impurities</em> and is therefore not really functional, even though it looks 'functional' on the surface, due to its heavy use of filters and projections.
    </p>
    <p>
        That example may leave some readers with the impression that there are some problems that, due to size or other 'real-world' constraints, are impossible to solve with functional programming. The present catalogue of design alternatives is my attempt to disabuse readers of that notion.
