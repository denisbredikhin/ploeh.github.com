		If you've seen my presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/FPEEiX5unWI">Fractal Architecture</a>, you may have wondered how I made the animation where a regular(ish) hexagonal grid emerges from adding more and more blobs to an area.

		Like <a href="/2021/04/05/mazes-on-voronoi-tesselations">a few</a> <a href="/2021/07/05/fractal-hex-flowers">previous</a> blog posts, today's article appears on <a href="https://observablehq.com">Observable</a>, which is where the animation and the code that creates it lives. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@ploeh/a-regular-grid-emerges">Go there to read it</a>.

		If you have time, watch the animation evolve. Personally I find it quite mesmerising.
