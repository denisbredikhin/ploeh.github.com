    <a href="http://grean.com">Grean</a> has kindly open-sourced a library we've used internally for several projects: <a href="https://github.com/GreanTech/AtomEventStore">AtomEventStore</a>. It's pretty nice, if I may say so.
  </p>
  <p>
    It comes with quite a bit of <a href="https://github.com/GreanTech/AtomEventStore/wiki">documentation</a>, and is also <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AtomEventStore">available on NuGet</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The original inspiration came from <a href="http://seabites.wordpress.com">Yves Reynhout</a>'s article <a href="https://seabites.wordpress.com/2011/12/07/your-eventstream-is-a-linked-list/">Your EventStream is a linked list</a>.
