    Many programmers enjoy fine dining. Regular readers may have noticed that I belong to that group of people.

<p>
    I'm fortunate to live in Copenhagen, which sports world-renowned restaurants. When such establishments enter the World elite, it can be more than difficult to make a reservation. I have, however, managed to reserve a table for four at <a href="https://alchemist.dk/">Alchemist</a>, which is currently <a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50">rated as the World's eighth-best restaurant</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you'd like to join me for an extraordinary dining experience, I'd like to offer the opportunity.

    The reservation is for four people, Wednesday, 10 September 2025, 18:00, at Alchemist, Refshalevej 173C, Copenhagen, Denmark. Expect the dinner to take all evening.

    It's in the outer harbour, and about an hour's walk from the centre of Copenhagen, so you'll probably need to take a taxi or bus. I'll meet you there at 18:00.

    Alchemist is a World-class restaurant, and the prices reflect that. If you're not used to fine dining in Copenhagen, the prices will shock you.
</p>
<p>
    You can join me for 12,000 DKK per person. This includes the set menu of up to 50 servings and either the Essential wine, Botanica, or Combined pairing of your choice.

    If you'd like to join me for this fantastic dinner, <a href="/about/#contact">send me an email</a>. I'll then send you an PDF invoice. Due to EU whitewashing regulations, I cannot accept checks; only (international) bank transfers.
